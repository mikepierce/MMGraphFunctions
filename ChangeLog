    - Created the file `Brute-Force-Search.nb` and related files to outline 
      how a brute-force search for MMNE and MMNC graphs was conducted.
    - Moved the `usage` message for each function to be above each function in
      the source file, and made each `usage` function human readable.
    - Added constants `K6` and `J1` to the package.
    - Thoroughly updated the README.
