# Minor-Minimal Graph Functions

A Mathematica package that contains functions 
related to finding the forbidden minors of a given graph property.
In particular, this package has functions relating to the properties
of a graph being [apex][APEX], edge-apex, or contraction-apex.

# Functions



# ToDo
 
 - Finish writing this README.
 - Have some kind of code review done. See if any of the functions can be made more efficient.
   Ask if there is some better way (that I don't already know) to organize a Mathematica package.
 - Be open to suggestions/recommendations/requests.
